# What is Vue Clerk?

Vue Clerk is a wrapper around ClerkJS. It's a way to integrate Clerk into your Vue application.

Vue Clerk provides Vue implementations of [Clerk Components](https://clerk.com/components/sign-in); highly customizable, pre-built components that you can use to build beautiful user management applications. You can find display components for building [sign in](https://clerk.com/components/sign-in), [sign up](https://clerk.com/components/sign-up), [account switching](https://clerk.com/components/user-button) and [user profile management](https://clerk.com/components/user-profile) pages as well as flow [control components](https://clerk.com/docs/component-reference/clerk-loaded) that act as helpers for implementing a seamless authentication experience.

Vue Clerk comes loaded with custom [composables](/composables/use-clerk.html). These composables give you access to the [Clerk object](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/clerk), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up.

::: info
To reduce the time of going back and forth between the official [Clerk docs](https://clerk.com/docs) and the Vue Clerk docs, we have copied most of the content you will see here from the Clerk docs and added some Vue-specific information.
